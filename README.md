# Cola or Die

A simple challenge mod for [_Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead_](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/).

It requires your character to consume cola every 24 hours. If you don't, you die.

## Caveats

- You will know you need cola by the effect popping up in your character window, as well as by a rather obvious message you get when you receive said effect
- The craving will only begin 24 hours from the moment of the character's start, so in effect, you get 24 hours pressure-free to find some cola
- Only "pure" colas are valid to satisfy the craving: **dark cola**, **energy cola**, and **diet cola**. Cola cocktails and mixes will have no effect on the craving
- You will be notified about the craving via a log message every 3 hours
- Adding this mod mid-playthrough is likely possible but hasn't been tested (please report the results if you do so)
